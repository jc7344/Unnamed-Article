**Methodology** 

Given the fact that the study aims to establish a spatial correlation between population with a specific socioeconomic characteristic and their distance to the nearest LinkNYC kiosk, a comparison between two average distances was proposed in the form of the following research question and hypotheses:

**Are New Yorkers living below poverty, significantly more likely to be isolated from LinkNYC kiosk network, in comparison to New Yorkers living in low poverty?**

*Null Hypothesis:*
The mean distance to LinkNYC kiosks for New Yorkers living below poverty is the same or less than the mean distance to LinkNYC kiosks for New Yorkers in low poverty, significance level = 0.05.

*Alternative Hypothesis:*
The mean distance to LinkNYC kiosks for New Yorkers living below poverty is more than the mean distance to LinkNYC kiosks for New Yorkers in low poverty, significance level = 0.05

The study also selected a significance level of .05 and a Z-test for hypothesis testing. The selection of the mentioned test responded to the nature of the study. As the goal of the analysis was to compare the average distance of two populations; the groups’ standard deviation was known; the sample had a considerable size (an increasingly larger sample size makes the unknown nature of the variance less relevant), and the analyzed values followed a Gaussian distribution, the Z-test presented itself as the best alternative to a non-parametric test. It is fair to say, however, that not all experiments contain values that are normally distributed and the value of the standard deviation is not always known. 

In similar circumstances, but with smaller sample sizes and distributions, a t-test could have been employed as a way to determine a difference between two different segments of the population. This project’s selection had the goal of utilizing all available information with a significant statistical power.
