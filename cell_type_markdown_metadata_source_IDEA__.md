    "#### IDEA:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is demand for expanded citibike service in Upper Manhattan / Harlem / Columbia University.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HYPOTHESIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0:$ The average rides (normalized per dock) on any given day that *start* along the north edge of the Citibike service zone in Manhattan (all Citibike stations between 86th St. and 81st St.) is *less than or equal to* that of Citibike stations in a similar, but non-boundary, region of Manhattan (between 81st St. and 72nd St). Timeframe set as a most recent complete 4 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### $H_0: mean(rides/dock)_{boundary} <= mean(rides/dock)_{non-boundary}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_1:$ The average rides (normalized per bike) on any given day that *start* along the north edge of the Citibike service zone in Manhattan (all Citibike stations between 86th St. and 81st St.) is *greater than* that of Citibike stations in a similar, but non-boundary, region of Manhattan (between 81st St. and 72nd St). Timeframe set as a most recent complete 4 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### $H_1: mean(rides/dock)_{boundary} > mean(rides/dock)_{non-boundary}$\n",

    "#### SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL:\n",

    "For this test, I'll use a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$\n",
