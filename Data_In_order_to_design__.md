**Data**

In order to design a coherent spatial analysis experiment, it was necessary to identify the following data as suitable for establishing a statistically significant relationship between the existence of socioeconomic variables (poverty and income) and the subjects’ location throughout the city’s political and administrative districts. In addition to both tabular and spatial data, provided by the American Community Survey, the Department of City Planning and the Census Bureau’s cartographic catalogue, the study selected spatial data available at New Yok City’s Open Data portal. Below, the detailed location of selected data is displayed:

•	Total Population by census tract (Tabular data-ACS 2009-2012 American Community Survey).

•	Census tract Shapefile for New York City (Spatial data -Census Bureau Cartographic boundaries and products) 

•	LinkNYC locations (Tabular data-NYC open data)

•	MapPLUTO Shapefile (Spatial data -Bytes of the Big Apple)

•	Internet Use (Tabular data-ACS 2014 estimates).

•	Poverty (Tabular data-ACS 2009-2012 estimates)

•	Median income in the past 12 months (in 2014 inflation-adjusted dollars) Tabular data-ACS 2009-2012 five year estimates.
